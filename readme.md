# Js Patterns

> Shoutout to [Do Factory](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns), [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/) for guiding me in this journey.

Design patterns are advanced object-oriented solutions to commonly occurring software problems.  Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.  Each pattern has a name and becomes part of a vocabulary when discussing complex design solutions.

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral

Below is a list of JS patterns

---
###  Creational Patterns

are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms and are used in situations when basic form of object creation could result in design problems or increase complexity of a code base.
 
---
1. Abstract Factory
2. Builder
3. Factory Method
4. Prototype
5. Singleton

---
### Structural Patterns

are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realise relationships between entities or defines a manner for creating relationships between objects.

---
6. Adapter
7. Bridge
9. Composite
10. Decorator
11. Facade
12. Flyweight
13. Proxy

Behavioural Patterns

explains how objects interact. It describes how different objects and classes send messages to each other to make things happen and how the steps of a task are divided among different objects. Where Creational patterns mostly describe a moment of time (the instant of creation), and Structural patterns describe a more or less static structure, Behavioral patterns describe a process or a flow
